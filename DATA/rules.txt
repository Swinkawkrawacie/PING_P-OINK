Move paddles and don't let the animal run away from the wolves' trap!
To move the paddles use:
[W], [S] for the left one,
[up], [down] for the right one.
Points represent the maximal amount of hits without losing the animal.
You have only 5 lives, so try not to die.
You can leave using [esc] or simply closing the window.
Good Luck!
