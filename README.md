# Game Title: PING P-OINK!
## Author: Julia Mazur

### Short description
Classic-not-classic ping pong arcade game, but instead of a ball you get an animal (with its own specific sound). <br/>
Rules are simple - don't let the wolves lose their prey. The goal is to keep the animal in the field as long as you can or beat your opponent.
